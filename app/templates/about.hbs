			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>
				Kenneth is a recovering <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html"
				                           target="_blank">architect astronaut</a>,
				based out of Calgary, Alberta. Back on earth, he spends his recovery time playing foosball, drinking
				coffee, and browsing hacker news.
			</p>

			<p>
				He finished his first degree in Archaeology in 2008 only to realize
				how much he loved computers. He knew he had "no choice" but to head back to school
				for a second degree in Computer Science. He has been helplessly addicted
				to software and programming ever since.
			</p>

			<p>
				While in school he paired up with his former archaeology department to produce different works
				including <a href="http://www.arcticiq.com" target="_blank">ArcticIQ</a>, a web based application geared
				towards
				the preservation and transmission of Inuit word meaning, and <a href="http://www.fortconger.ca"
				                                                                target="_blank">Fort Conger</a>,
				a maquette that was successful in securing funding through VMC Canada. He also enjoyed plenty of time
				at <a href="http://www.aquanode.com" target="_blank">Aquanode</a>, a small Calgary based dev shop.
			</p>

			<p>
				In 2013, he leaped straight out of university and directly into
				<a href="https://www.bridezillahq.com" target="_blank">Bridezillahq</a>, a startup geared towards
				disrupting the wedding market.
				He spent 14th months there as CTO before deciding that the wedding game wasn't his style. He is now on
				the lookout
				for his next big adventure. You can reach him at <a href="mailto:kenneth@kennethbuck.ca">kenneth@kennethbuck.ca</a>
				for opportunities and inquiries.
